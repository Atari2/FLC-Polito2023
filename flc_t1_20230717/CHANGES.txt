Nothing changed in the scanner (I just removed a part of a comment that was inaccurate).
In the parser:
- Before I was accessing <dress_name> and <perc> using synthesized attributes now I'm accessing them throught inherited attributes directly accessing the stack. 
  The total price is also now calculated via accumuling it in the inherited attribute rather than using a for-loop with an ArrayList.
  The original code was "unfinished" because I was mid-refactor when I had to stop working on it because time ran out.
- After finishing the change from synthesized to inherited attributes I could also delete some helper classes I was using (PurcProd.java, Purchase.java).
